Does weather have an impact on crime rates?
What are the patterns of criminal data in 5 large US cities?
Will examine compare to weather broken down by temperature, precipitation and length of day, by day
Excluding white collar crime, premeditated crime?
Cities with more annual precipitation

Questions and charts

Questions: 
What relation is there between average daytime temperature and total number of crimes committed during that day? The number of violent crimes? Number of traffic citations, etc.

What relation can be found between the daily average humidity and number of crimes committed during that day?  The number of violent crimes? Number of traffic citations, etc

Is there a relation between the daily average heat index and the crime statistics?

How does the total number of hours of daylight affect the crime rate? Is there a significant difference between quarterly crime rates of cities lying in different longitudinal ranges?

Do more crimes take place during the night or day? Are crime rates different during daytime and nighttime hours?

Charts:
Scatter plots: maybe a plot with x-axis showing daily average temp, y-axis showing daily average humidity, with each point representing a day of the year, colored according to the city name and sized according to the number of crimes that was committed during that day.	Simpler might be x-axis is average daily temp, humidity, rainfall, etc, and y-axis is average number of crimes committed on days that temperature., humidity, etc.


Miscellaneous Notes
Pick a random sample of 100,000 crime data from 5 cities and merge information for 2016 and looks at trends.
Then analyze the trends in the data based on weather (temperature and precipitation, length of days)
Baltimore: Date, time, location, inside or outside, crime code
DC: Date, time, location, primary description
Chicago: location, arrest or not, log/lat,, primary description (theft, battery,ect)
LA: long, lat, adult arrest, status description, crime description, crime code, road, area, time, date
